# What-Is-Membrane-Filtration-And-Why-Use-It-For-Water-Treatment-
With growing awareness about pollution and climate change, the concept and application of water reuse have increased over the past few years. Membrane filtration has become a vital method of water treatment, producing safe water fit for consumption or disposal into the environment. <br>

Many industries today produce massive amounts of wastewater or release hazardous gases that cause pollution. Membrane filtration can filter wastewater and reduce gaseous pollution, allowing water to be recycled and used for irrigation, maintenance, and other industrial processes. <br>

What is Membrane Filtration? <br>

In the most basic terms, membrane filtration is defined as a membrane separation process using membranes of ranging pore sizes. Membrane filters act as a barrier to separate contaminants from the feed water. Reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration and microfiltration all use membranes as a part of their filtration process. Each of these processes approaches the membrane filtration processes a bit differently. <br>

Membrane filtration in wastewater treatment is the process of removing particulate matter from the water by passing the water through a porous media or membrane. The medium used for filtration can be natural, like sand, gravel or clay, or it can also be a membrane wall made of various materials. These membranes serve various purposes like softening, disinfection, desalination and organic wastewater removal. Depending on the size of the materials that need to be filtered from the water, membrane filters come in varying sizes. They are categorized per their pore size as follows: <br>

Microfiltration is a membrane filtration method that removes only suspended solids, bacteria and fat globules. It can be implemented in the water treatment process when the particles that need to be removed have a diameter greater than 0.1mm. it is often used in the sterilization of beverages and pharmaceuticals, separation of bacteria from water in the biological wastewater treatment process, separation of water and oil and pre-treatment of water. <br>

Ultrafiltration uses membranes that have a larger pore size and the pressure of feed is relatively slow. It allows salts, sugars, organic acids and smaller peptides to pass while blocking proteins, fats and polysaccharides. Ultrafiltration can be used as pre-filtration for nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. <br>

Reverse Osmosis uses the tightest membrane in water treatment. Only water can permeate the membrane. All other materials like bacteria, fats, proteins, gums, salts, sugars and minerals are unable to pass through. <br>

Nanofiltration allows only small ions like minerals to pass through the membrane. Larger ions and organic compounds like bacteria, spores, proteins, gums, fats and sugars are blocked. It has a pore size of around 0.001 microns. <br>
Nanofiltration is not as fine as reverse osmosis and uses membranes that have a slightly larger pore size. <br>

Why use membrane filtration? <br>
•	Low overall production costs: One of the greatest benefits of membrane filtration is that the installation and maintenance of these systems are often less expensive compared to other water treatment processes. Membrane filtration includes fewer processing steps and helps achieve a greater degree of purity and higher yields. <br>

•	High flexibility: Membrane filtration can be used for feed products with varying viscosities. Using a wide range of membrane filtration systems also ensures that the best possible solution is used for every application. <br>

•	High-end product quality: Membrane filtration is a clean technology. This separation process is carried out on the basis of molecule size and removes the need for any additives. This results in an end product of high quality and also makes it easier to comply with the many stringent rules and regulations. Using membranes from the best membrane filters manufacturers in India will give you high-quality water for reuse or safe disposal. <br>

<a href="https://arvindkaigo.com/services/membrane-and-filters/kaimembrane.php">Membrane filters</a> are the future of green industries. Membrane filtration techniques are employed by many industries. Large-scale industrial applications that treat liquids and gases require membrane filter technology. <br>

Water filter membranes are a key piece of equipment used in many water treatment systems. This is why you need to buy membrane filters from the best membrane filters manufacturers in India.  By removing bacteria, viruses, and pathogens, water filter membranes can be used to purify drinking water as well as the surroundings of pools and spas to manage and prevent diseases. It can also be used to concentrate and purify liquids in the food and beverage industry. <br>
